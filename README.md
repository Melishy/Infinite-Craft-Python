# Infinite Craft in Minecraft

This mod allows players to **combine any two stacks of items on the ground** to produce another item, generated by AI. It was featured in the video: *I Made Infinite Craft in Minecraft*  

**<span style="color:red">Please keep in mind</span>**
this was my first Java mod - and the mod was originally intended exclusively for personal use so the code (and overall execution) is not as clean as it could be and I sincerely apologise for that. 

Feel free to download, critique and change my code however best suits you.

Note: The mod was coded in this 50% Java, 50% Python manner because this was my first time coding in Java and I am more familiar with Python. 

Note 2: This mod *could* be expanded to include modded items as some have suggested. Since the mod pulls specifically from the Minecraft Items list, the Java would have to be changed to include the package containing the modded items.

✅ You are now ready to play Infinite Craft in Minecraft. **Enjoy!**

Once again I apologise for the messy setup and code - but I hope you enjoy!

**Sidenote:** All previously crafted items are stored in `backlogDoc.txt` - meaning that you can clear the cache by deleting everything in the document. And force certain items to be craftable if you want.
